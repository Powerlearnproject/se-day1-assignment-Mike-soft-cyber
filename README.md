Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is a field of computer science that deals with designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining of high quality software products.
It's importances in the technology industry are:
- Reliability: It is able to function as it is intended to do.
- Scalability: it can handle increased load while still functioning properly with no problems.
- Security: provides protection through authentication, authorization, and security of user information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Mastering complexity
- Mastering process
- Maastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering information about the users' needs and the system requirements.
- Design: Creating a high level detailed design of the requirements gathered.
- Implementation: Writing the code of the design discussed previously.
- Testing: Conducting various tets to see whether the software performs its intended purpose and provide quality assurance.
- Deployment: The software is released for the users to use it.
- Maintenance: provides ongoing support of the software and provide updates on it.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology is the sequential approach to the softeare development life cycle while agile methodology is the iterative approach.
- Waterfall methodology has low flexibility while agile has high fexibility
- In waterfall methodology changes are hard to happen at the end of the phase while agile can adapt to changing requirements

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
- Creating applications and programs using programming languages and frameworks
- Working with team members to ensure high quality results
- Reporting their work to the project manager for progress
Quality Assurance
- Work with stakeholders to identify the software requirments
- Analyze the software product to see if there are bugs that need to be removed.
- Tests the software product before its deployment.
Product Manager
- Discusses the project and its requirements with the client and the software developers.
- Tracks the progres the project.
- Releases the software project to the client and monitors its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments(IDEs) provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Example is Visual Studio Code.
- Version Control Systems provide tools for tracking the source code. For example Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The common challenges include:
- Changes in the requiremnts during the development of the software.
- Having tight deadlines to deliver the project which can lead to unwanted quality.
- Staying up to date with the latest technology trends.
To overcome these challenges include effective communication, using agile methodologies, and using scalable architecture. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing: It involves testing each component of a software.
- System testing: It involves testing the entire software.
- Integration testing: It involves testing interaction between different components of the system
- Acceptance testing: It involves testing the software to make sure it meets user requirements.
Importance: It makes sure the software meeds the desired quality standards and functional requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering involves creating questions or statements to get the best response from AI models.
- Its importance in interacting with AI models is that it helpsimprove interactions between AI and humans. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Draw a picture of students in a classroom with a teacher in front of the class teaching.
- Clear: the improved prompt specifies what is being asked.
- Specific: Describes the appearance of the classroom, the color of the students' uniform and what the teacher is wearing.
- Concise: Provides additional details like what was the teacher writing on the board.
